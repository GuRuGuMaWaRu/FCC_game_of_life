## FreeCodeCamp React Project - Game of Life

## User Story
- [ ] When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
- [ ] I can start and stop the board.
- [ ] I can set up the board.
- [ ] I can clear the board.
- [ ] When I press start, the game will play out.

## Thoughts
There is still much to be improved, like for example performance! I'd also like to rewrite the components structure, use HOCs more often, write tests and change how gameboard is recalculated. But that is all for another time, when I get better.
